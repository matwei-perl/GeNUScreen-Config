GeNUScreen-Config version 0.0.1

GeNUScreen::Config is a perl module that supports the work with
GeNUScreen firewalls. It allows you to easily compare different versions
and types of firewall configuration files, identify changes and display
any aspect of a given configuration as clearly arranged as possible.

There are two types of configuration files used with these firewalls.
One is exported via the web interface while the other is accessible as
file 'config.hdf' via secure shell from the firewall. Although both of
them are fully equvialent on the semantic level they differ
syntactically. With GeNUScreen::Config you may work with either of the
files and are able to tell whether they belong to the same
configuration. If you want to compare two different configurations you
get the difference in a simple yet unambigous form.
